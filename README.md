# LynkLynk — Personal Knowledge Constellations

LYNKLYNK is an app that turns your notes, documents, and ideas into a living knowledge constellation. Instead of isolated files or scattered thoughts, LYNKLYNK automatically parses your content and creates nodes (concepts) and links (relationships) so you can visually explore how everything you’ve learned connects over time.

## Core Features

* Automatic Node Creation: Type a note, import a PDF, or ask the AI a question — LYNKLYNK extracts key concepts and turns them into nodes.

* Semantic Linking: The app identifies relationships between ideas across all your documents and builds a graph that grows with you.

* Contextual Retrieval: Search or click a node to see related notes, past thoughts, references, and insights — even from months ago.

* Visual Constellation View: Explore your knowledge as a dynamic graph where clusters form naturally around your interests and projects.

* Unified Memory: LYNKLYNK acts like your long-term, cross-contextual memory, helping you resurface forgotten information and see patterns.

Use Cases
Personal research notebook
Learning tracker
Writing & worldbuilding
Knowledge management
Project planning / brainstorming

## The Goal: to make your information feel alive, interconnected, and instantly retrievable — like having your own semantic memory system.
